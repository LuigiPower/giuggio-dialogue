# Final Project for the Language Understanding Systems project

## Installation

This is a website developed using AngularJS and Angular Material.
To install the required packages, npm is required.

Inside the project's root directory run:
```bash
    npm install
```

Then access the folder with any browser.

MySQL is required, with the specific movie database used for development.

## Possible problems

To make the FST and SLU utilities work on my system, every command
using the fstutilities was replaced by their absolute path (inside /usr/local/bin).
This could be problematic on other systems.
